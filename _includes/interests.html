			    My personal interests include:
        </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				 <b>Deep learning</b>. It's an exciting time for machine learning. I'm working through several online classes, and swap articles with collegues.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>RC Planes and Boats</b>. I've been an enthusiastic hobbiest since I was a teenager - but only as an adult am I able to afford the higher-quality
          devices. I like to modify existing kits to improve speed, and add instrumentation.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Football</b>. Anything more to say about the jogo bonito?      
      </li>
			</ul>

  			<li>
          My favorite project by far is a mathematical simulation of the Gauss Jordan Elimination method over any algebraic field. I really went deep into algebraic analysis to mine out the necessary data I needed to succesfully complete this project.
    		</li>
  			<li>
          I also developed a project management system where the faculty of my Uni can keep track of their projects and also their earnings.
  			</li>
